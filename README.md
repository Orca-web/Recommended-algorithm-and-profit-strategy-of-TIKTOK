# Recommended-algorithm-and-profit-strategy-of-TIKTOK

Hello, here is the project that my partner and I completed for ECON7920 Executive Workshop Series during the MSc in Data Analytics & Business Economics program at Hong Kong Baptist university.

This project is in the context of the rapid rise of TikTok short video app in the world. 

It aims to compare TikTok and the similar products, and analyse TikTok's core recommendation algorithm, author profit strategy, and platform profit strategy, and find out why the TikTok is so successful.
